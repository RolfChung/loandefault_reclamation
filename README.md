# loandefault_reclamation
Checking retrieval of borrowings from written off loans through recovery strategies with inferential statistics.

Sometimes borrowers are not paying back their loans from back.
Bad debt is written off by the banks, but even then different strategies can
be applied to collect at least some amount of the credit amount for
example by making a phone call and talk personally to the customer.

However, is the gain to collect a part of the sum worth the effort?
Given some assumptions about the defaulter the bank can come up with an
expected recovery amount. The higher the expected recovery amount the more
effort should the bank put into collection. The higher the effort the higher the cost (\$50 per recovery level). Based on this the bank implements
different recovery strategies or a bundle of actions at different levels or thresholds of expected recovery amounts (1000, 2000, 3000, 5000).
The additional cost at each threshold must be at least covered by the
additional collection. Is this the case?

Still does the recovery system work?
The bank has conducted this approach for some time and has gathered data
about actual recovery amounts. A simple approach would be to calculate the
difference between actual recovery amounts and expected recovery amounts.
The overall difference is positive for this sample is positive.
However even if the overall difference is positive for this sample is positive. this "snapshot" says nothing about the significance of the
difference. Is the sample of recovery amounts generalizable
to the population of recovery amounts?
For this conclusion methods of statistical inference are necessary.
